# AI Coding Base Setup

Cross-platform installer/updater for **Claude Code, opencode, OpenAI Codex, and Cursor Agent** configurations. Syncs the same set of MCPs across all four CLIs, plus Claude-specific skills, hooks, plugins, and statusline. Runs on Mint Linux, WSL, Windows, and devcontainers (DevPod / Codespaces / Dev Containers).

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vossiman/aiCodingBaseSetup.git
cd aiCodingBaseSetup
./install.sh
```

On first run, you'll be prompted for API keys. Press Enter to skip any you don't have yet.

## What Gets Installed

### CLIs

The installer ensures four AI coding CLIs are present and configured:

| CLI | Binary | Login | Auth file persisted at |
|-----|--------|-------|------------------------|
| Claude Code | `claude` | `claude` (browser OAuth) | `~/.claude/.credentials.json` |
| opencode | `opencode` | `opencode auth login <provider>` | `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` |
| OpenAI Codex | `codex` | `codex` (first run — ChatGPT sign-in or `OPENAI_API_KEY`) | `~/.codex/auth.json` |
| Cursor Agent | `agent` (or `cursor-agent` on older releases) | `agent login` (or `CURSOR_API_KEY`) | `~/.config/cursor/auth.json` — `install.sh` symlinks `~/.config/cursor` into the bind-mounted `~/.aicodingsetup/cursor-config` so login is once-ever across pods (the mounted `~/.cursor` holds only MCP config, not credentials) |

All four read the same 4 MCP servers; auth state persists across containers via bind-mounted home directories (DevPod setup — see "Devcontainers" below).

### MCP Servers

Configured for **all four CLIs**: `claude mcp add` for Claude Code (existing), `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` `mcp` field for opencode, `~/.codex/config.toml` `[mcp_servers.*]` tables for codex, and `~/.cursor/mcp.json` `mcpServers` object for cursor-agent. Same four servers, four config formats — `install.sh` deploys each from a template in `configs/`.

| MCP | Purpose | Auth |
|-----|---------|------|
| firecrawl | Web scraping and content extraction | API key |
| brave-search | Web, news, image, video search | API key |
| context7 | Library documentation lookup (via Docker) | None |
| playwright | Browser automation, screenshots, testing | None (via plugin) |

### Claude Code Plugins (Marketplace)

- superpowers (brainstorming, TDD, plans, code review, debugging)
- frontend-design
- playwright
- code-simplifier
- skill-creator
- code-review
- claude-code-setup
- pyright-lsp

### Custom Skills (shared by Claude Code and opencode)

| Skill | Purpose | Auth |
|-------|---------|------|
| cloudflare-browser | Fetch web content via Cloudflare Browser Rendering REST API (backup for firecrawl) | API token |

### Hooks

- **custom-statusline.js** — Powerline-style status bar with context window, rate limits, git branch
- **bw-deny-files.sh** — Blocks AI access to sensitive files (from [bw-AICode](https://github.com/vossiman/bw-AICode))
- **check-archived-docs.sh** — SessionStart hook. Emits a one-line banner when a scaffolded project has docs with `status: done` in any `docs/*/active/` folder. Fail-open.

### Slash commands

- **/scaffold-project** — Drops the canonical project layout (`CLAUDE.md`, `TODO.md`, `docs/{specs,plans,notes}/{active,archive}/`, project `.claude/settings.json`) into the current directory. Interactive: asks for name and one-line purpose. Refuses to clobber existing files.
- **/housekeep** — Sweeps `docs/*/active/` for docs with `status: done` frontmatter and moves them into the sibling `archive/`. Also prunes `[x]` items older than 14 days from `TODO.md`.

### Project templates

Installed to `~/.aicodingsetup/templates/project/`. Used by `/scaffold-project` to materialize a new project. The repo is the source of truth — re-running `install.sh` mirrors the latest templates over.

### Container-side helpers

- **`~/.bashrc.d/aicoding-env.sh`** — empty by default; put container-wide `export FOO=bar` lines here. Sourced from every login shell via the managed block in `~/.bashrc`.
- **`~/.bashrc.d/aicoding-ssh-auth-sock.sh`** — stabilizes the forwarded SSH agent socket across DevPod / Cursor reconnects. Routes every shell through `~/.ssh/agent.sock` (a symlink we keep current). Without it, long-lived tmux panes hold a stale `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` path after the host's SSH session rotates, and `git push` fails with `Permission denied (publickey)` until you open a new pane.
- **`~/.codex/config.toml`** — overwrite-mode managed file; declares the 4 MCPs in TOML `[mcp_servers.<name>]` tables with secrets substituted at deploy time. Tracked in `manifest.json`; redeployed on every rebuild via `reconcile`.
- **`~/.cursor/mcp.json`** — merge-mode managed file; declares the 4 MCPs in JSON `{mcpServers: ...}` (Claude-Desktop-compatible schema). User-added entries are preserved by the merge.

### External Tools (detected, not installed)

- **infra-audit** — Python project infrastructure auditor ([python-infra-audit-cc](https://github.com/vossiman/python-infra-audit-cc))
## Secrets

Secrets are stored at `~/.aicodingsetup/.secrets.env` (outside the repo).

| Key | Used By |
|-----|---------|
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | firecrawl MCP |
| `BRAVE_API_KEY` | brave-search MCP |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | cloudflare-browser skill |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | cloudflare-browser skill |
- **Install:** prompts for all keys (Enter to skip)
- **Update:** only prompts for new keys, never overwrites existing values
- MCP keys are injected into MCP config blocks
- Skill keys are substituted directly into SKILL.md files

In devcontainers the file is bind-mounted **read-only** (a single-file mount
stacked over the rw `~/.aicodingsetup` mount) so no in-container tooling or
agent can rewrite or delete the host-side source of truth. Two consequences:

- The file must **exist on the host before provisioning** (`touch
  ~/devpod/aicodingsetup/.secrets.env` on a fresh host) — Docker creates a
  *directory* in place of a missing single-file bind source.
- A single-file bind pins the file's inode: after editing on the host with a
  rename-on-save editor (vim, `sed -i`), running containers keep seeing the
  old content until restarted. Edit in place (`nano`, `echo >>`) or restart
  the container after rotating tokens.

## Update

Two distinct flows after the initial install:

### `aicoding-sync` — day-2 reconciliation (recommended)

```bash
aicoding-sync --dry-run    # show what would change vs your environment
aicoding-sync              # interactive — single y/N confirm, inline diff for drift
aicoding-sync --yes        # scripted — auto-confirms; backs up anything drifted
```

`aicoding-sync` is installed into `~/.local/bin/` by `install.sh`. It compares three hashes per managed file (currently on disk, last-deployed per the manifest, current blueprint source) and classifies each file into one of seven outcomes. Drifted files (you modified them) are surfaced with full inline `diff -u` output and backed up to `<file>.bak.<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>` before being overwritten. Missing-on-disk managed files are classified as `restore` and silently re-deployed. It also reconciles machine state shared with `install.sh` via `lib/provision.sh` — MCP registrations, marketplace plugins, and the npm packages backing stdio MCPs (throttled on `--boot`, always on manual runs).

(The former `aicoding-update` and `update-status` names were back-compat shims and have been removed; use `aicoding-sync` and `aicoding-status`.)

The manifest at `~/.aicodingsetup/manifest.json` records the blueprint commit and a per-file hash for every overwrite-mode file, plus a block-hash for the marker-guarded section of `~/.bashrc`.

### `aicoding-install` — pull latest and re-run the installer

```bash
aicoding-install                     # refresh /tmp/aicoding to origin/main, re-run install.sh
aicoding-install --force-reinstall   # same, but deletes the manifest first (nuke drift, first-deploy)
```

Re-running the installer on an initialized container (manifest exists) re-runs the apt/build/locale prereq steps (idempotent) **and** then runs **reconcile mode**, which automatically applies the conservative buckets without any prompts. Use it when provisioning-only pieces broke or changed (tool bootstrap incl. codex, templates, tmux plugins, Playwright browser) — `aicoding-sync` deliberately doesn't touch those. Running `./install.sh` from a checkout does the same against that checkout's version.

### Per-CLI binary refresh (`aicoding-sync --boot`)

Different CLIs have different in-place update stories. Container `postStartCommand`
runs `on-start.sh` → `aicoding-sync --boot`, which (among other things) refreshes
CLI binaries on a throttle. Behaviour per CLI:

| CLI | Update path | Run on every start? |
|-----|-------------|---------------------|
| Claude Code | `claude update` | ✅ (throttled) |
| opencode | `opencode upgrade` | ✅ (throttled) |
| Cursor Agent | `agent update` (or `cursor-agent update` on older releases) | ✅ (throttled) |
| OpenAI Codex | None — no in-place subcommand exists upstream | ❌ — pinned at install-time. Re-run the installer when you want a newer version, OR use `./install.sh --force-reinstall` which re-invokes `ensure_codex`. |

(`update.sh` is a one-line legacy shim that execs `on-start.sh`; prefer `on-start.sh` / `aicoding-sync --boot`.)

Failures on any of the in-place updates are non-fatal and surface as `WARN:` lines so a transient network blip doesn't block container start.

### Install modes

`install.sh` picks one of three modes based on what it finds:

| State on disk | Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| No manifest, no managed files exist | `first` | Deploys everything; writes initial manifest. |
| No manifest, but managed files already on disk (older install) | `adopt` | Captures current file hashes into the manifest without overwriting. Surfaces accumulated drift on the next `aicoding-sync --dry-run`. |
| Manifest exists | `reconcile` | Re-runs prereqs, then auto-applies the conservative buckets (see below). |

**Reconcile mode** runs every time `install.sh` is invoked on a container that already has a manifest (e.g., every devcontainer rebuild). It classifies each managed file and automatically applies the conservative buckets:
- `restore` (file tracked but missing on disk → redeploy from blueprint)
- `new_file` (in blueprint inventory, not yet in manifest → deploy)
- `will_update` (tracked, unedited locally, blueprint changed → deploy)
- `drifted_but_aligned` (you edited to match the new blueprint → refresh manifest hash, no file write)
- `merge` (settings.json / opencode.json → deep-merge blueprint over local)

It deliberately does **not** auto-apply two buckets:
- `drifted_and_updating` (you edited AND blueprint changed differently) — reported, left for `aicoding-sync`.
- `to_remove` (file dropped from blueprint inventory) — reported, never auto-deleted.

This is strictly more conservative than `aicoding-sync --yes`, which DOES auto-resolve drift (with backup) and DOES auto-remove. The automatic provisioning path is intentionally more cautious about touching files the user has edited.

The `~/.bashrc.d/` convention for user additions: anything matching `local-*.sh` (or any name *not* prefixed `aicoding-`) is sourced by the managed block but never touched by the blueprint. Personal aliases, env vars, and shell tweaks belong there.

### Why the model

The pre-manifest installer would silently clobber any file you'd hand-edited on every re-run. The manifest + drift detection lets the installer guarantee "your changes are never overwritten without a prompt." See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-16-blueprint-sync-design.md` in the parent [devMachine](https://github.com/vossiman/devMachine) repo for the full design.

> The container hostname is set to the workspace name via runArgs:
> `["--hostname", "${containerWorkspaceFolderBasename}"]`, so shells and logs
> show e.g. `devmachine` instead of a docker id.

## Windows

```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

> **Note:** Windows support is a stub. MCPs, plugins, hooks, and skills work. Settings merge and opencode config are deferred until Windows config paths are verified.

## Devcontainers (DevPod / Codespaces / VS Code Dev Containers)

When run inside a container, `install.sh` detects the environment automatically and:

- Auto-installs prerequisites it needs (`git`, `jq`, `claude` CLI, `locales` + `de_AT.UTF-8`/`en_US.UTF-8`) via apt/npm. No manual prep.
- Skips interactive prompts for missing API keys (assumes secrets are bind-mounted from the host or absent).

Detection triggers on any of: `/.dockerenv`, `/run/.containerenv`, `REMOTE_CONTAINERS`, `DEVCONTAINER`, or `CODESPACES` env vars.

To force the same behaviour on a host (e.g. CI), set:

```bash
AICODINGSETUP_AUTO_INSTALL=1 AICODINGSETUP_NONINTERACTIVE=1 ./install.sh
```

### Drop-in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

Canonical template lives next to this README at [`devcontainer.json`](./devcontainer.json). Copy it into your project's `.devcontainer/` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .devcontainer
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vossiman/aiCodingBaseSetup/main/devcontainer.json \
  -o .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
```

`postCreateCommand` clones this repo and runs its `install.sh` once on container creation; `postStartCommand` curls `on-start.sh` from this repo on every container start, which runs the unified sync in `--boot` mode to keep `claude` and `opencode` binaries fresh.

`containerEnv` overrides three `BASH_FUNC_*%%` env vars that universal:6 leaks with truncated multi-line bodies — without it bash errors on every spawn (see [vscode#3928](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3928), [vscode-remote-release#9457](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/9457)). `install.sh` and `update.sh` further re-exec themselves under `env -u` to belt-and-braces the same problem.

`remoteUser` must match the image's hardcoded user — `codespace` for `universal:6`, `vscode` for most others (`python`, `base`, etc.). Mismatch → mounts land at the wrong path and nothing works.

The template ships with `"mounts": [...]` wired for a DevPod-style backend (e.g. `vossisrv` hosting all containers): bind-mounting five dirs gives all four CLIs persistent state across every container the user spins up:

| Host source | Container target | What persists |
|---|---|---|
| `…/aicodingsetup/` | `~/.aicodingsetup/` | `.secrets.env`, `manifest.json` |
| `…/aicodingsetup/.secrets.env` | `~/.aicodingsetup/.secrets.env` (**read-only**) | overlay on the row above — see "Secrets" |
| `…/claude/` | `~/.claude/` | Claude credentials, settings, plugins |
| `…/opencode/` | `~/.local/share/opencode/` | opencode `auth.json` (per-provider tokens) |
| `…/codex/` | `~/.codex/` | codex `auth.json` + `config.toml` |
| `…/cursor/` | `~/.cursor/` | cursor-agent credentials + `mcp.json` |

`install.sh` re-deploys `~/.codex/config.toml` and `~/.cursor/mcp.json` on every rebuild via `reconcile`, so config drift heals automatically — auth files persist untouched.

These `source=` paths assume a `~/devpod/...` host layout. If your host differs, edit the `source=` paths to match, or drop any mounts you don't need — the template works without them, you just lose cross-container persistence for those tools.

### Why both `.credentials.json` and `~/.claude.json` matter

Claude Code reads OAuth tokens from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` *and* checks `~/.claude.json` (a file at home root, **not** inside `.claude/`) for `hasCompletedOnboarding: true`. Without that flag, the CLI treats every session as a fresh install and prompts for login even when valid tokens exist. `install.sh` writes that flag automatically when it sets up MCPs — without it, copying the credentials file alone is not sufficient to authenticate a container.

### Agent logins (one-time interactive)

All four CLIs use the same pattern: log in once in any DevPod workspace, and the credential file lands in the bind-mounted home directory — every future workspace inherits the auth automatically.

| CLI | Login command | Where the token lands |
|-----|---------------|------------------------|
| Claude Code | `claude` → browser OAuth flow | `~/.claude/.credentials.json` |
| opencode | `opencode auth login <provider>` | `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` |
| OpenAI Codex | `codex` on first run → ChatGPT sign-in (or `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var) | `~/.codex/auth.json` |
| Cursor Agent | `agent login` (or `cursor-agent login`) — or `CURSOR_API_KEY` env var | inside `~/.cursor/` |

HTTP-based MCPs that need their own OAuth (logfire, claude.ai Google Drive, etc.) still require a browser flow per-MCP via `claude` → `/mcp` → select the MCP → follow the link. State persists in the bind-mounted `~/.claude/`, so every future workspace inherits it.

## How It Works

```
install.sh
  1. Detect environment (Linux / WSL / container)
  2. Auto-install prereqs in container mode (git, jq, claude CLI, locales, tmux)
  3. Load or prompt for secrets (~/.aicodingsetup/.secrets.env — non-interactive in containers)
  4. Report unmanaged components (leave untouched)
  5. Configure Claude Code MCPs (claude mcp add)
  6. Install Claude Code marketplace plugins
  7. Install aicoding-sync symlink → ~/.local/bin/aicoding-sync
  8. Detect install mode (first / adopt / reconcile) — see Update section
  9. Deploy managed files (first mode) OR adopt existing hashes (adopt mode) OR
     auto-apply conservative buckets (reconcile mode). Writes / updates the manifest.
 10. Install tmux plugins (TPM), clone/update bubblewrap, detect infra-audit,
     check Playwright
```

File deployment is centralised in `lib/blueprint-deploy.sh`. Every managed file flows through one of three deploy modes (`overwrite`, `merge`, `marker_block`), captured in the manifest at `~/.aicodingsetup/manifest.json` so subsequent `aicoding-sync` runs can detect and surface drift.

The same persist-once-share-everywhere property applies to all four CLIs once their bind mounts are wired: `claude`, `opencode`, `codex`, and `agent` each persist their auth into their respective bind-mounted home directories, so a single login in any container is reusable from every other.

```

Per-CLI MCP configs live under `configs/{codex,cursor,opencode}/` plus Claude
registration via `lib/provision.sh` (`MANAGED_MCPS`). There is no shared
`mcps.json` generator yet — keep those lists in sync by hand when adding an MCP.

## Two delivery channels (dev vs runtime)

| Channel | What | When |
|---------|------|------|
| **Parent submodule** (`devMachine` → `devpod/aicoding`) | Editable checkout pinned to a SHA | Developing / reviewing this repo |
| **Runtime tracking clone** (`/tmp/aicoding` → GitHub `main`) | What containers install & sync from | `postCreate`, `aicoding-install`, `aicoding-sync` refresh |

Edits in the submodule do **not** affect a running container until they land on
`main` (or you point `AICODING_BLUEPRINT_CLONE` / `AICODING_BLUEPRINT_REMOTE` at
your checkout). `dvw new` seeds `devcontainer.json` from tip-of-`main` by default
(`DVW_BLUEPRINT_DEVCONTAINER_URL`).

## Test Your Setup

After running the installer, paste the test prompt from `test-prompt.md` into Claude Code or opencode to verify everything works.
