Managed by the aiCodingBaseSetup blueprint (`configs/codex/AGENTS.md`);
`aicoding-sync` overwrites local edits — change it there, via PR.

## Memory retrieval

A persistent memory system (memory-lanes) indexes durable knowledge from all
past sessions and the homelab wiki. Call the `memory_search` tool on the
`memory-router` MCP server whenever the answer may live outside the current
repo and conversation — prior decisions, past incidents, environment facts,
"have we solved this before" — BEFORE re-deriving it or answering from
assumption. Treat results as leads and verify before relying on them. If the
router is unavailable, fall back to grepping the local `~/homelab-wiki` clone
(clone `https://github.com/vossiman/homelab-wiki` if missing); if both fail,
proceed without retrieval rather than blocking.

Durable lessons (gotchas, incidents, environment quirks) belong in the
homelab-wiki — follow its `AGENTS.md` conventions — never in project repos.
